# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection

A machine learning project that classifies emails as spam or not spam using natural language processing and supervised learning techniques.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project uses a **Naive Bayes classifier** combined with **TF-IDF vectorization** to detect spam emails. The model is trained on labeled text data and evaluated using standard performance metrics.
